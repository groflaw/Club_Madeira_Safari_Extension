# Support — Club Madeira Amazon Tag (Safari Extension)

**How we help:** This extension appends our Amazon.co.uk affiliate tag to product URLs so eligible purchases can be attributed to us. It does not collect, store, or transmit personal data.

## Contact Support
- Email: **si@ntsa.uk**  
We typically reply within 1~2 business days.

## Get Started
### macOS
1. Open **Safari** → **Settings** → **Extensions**.  
2. Check **Club Madeira Amazon Tag** to enable it.  
3. (Optional) Select the extension in the sidebar to **Allow in Private Browsing** and to **Edit Websites** access for `amazon.co.uk`.

### iPhone / iPad
1. Open **Settings** → **Safari** → **Extensions**.  
2. Tap **Club Madeira Amazon Tag** and **Allow Extension**.

> You can limit website access or turn the extension off anytime in Safari settings.

## Permissions (Why Safari asks)
Safari shows a notice like “read or modify on amazon.co.uk” because the extension needs to **append the affiliate parameter** to the URL. No other sites are affected, and nothing is sent to our servers.

## Troubleshooting
- **Can’t enable the extension?** Update macOS/iOS and try again. If you still can’t enable, see Apple’s help pages.  
- **Uninstall / Reinstall (Mac):** Safari → Settings → **Extensions** → select the extension → **Uninstall**; then reinstall from the App Store.

## Privacy
We don’t collect personal data. See our **[Privacy Policy](https://groflaw.github.io/Club_Madeira_Safari_Extension/Privacy%20Policy.html)**.

## Changelog
